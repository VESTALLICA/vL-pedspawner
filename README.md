--

some features:

has templates for creating patrol routes and custom relationships for peds.

can define multiple spawn points and models to a single ped for randomness.

can place a qbtarget for events on the peds. 
(resource is standalone, just disable qbtargets)

give a primary and secondary weapon with attachments and edit their combat behavior and general pathing.

10/28 update: 
instead of defining a ped route, you can now opt to make the ped wander in a location instead. 
can play a scenario on the peds and can make them not react to anything around them. 
optional customizable blip for ped.
please download the new version
